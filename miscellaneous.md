# Miscellaneous questions

1. How do I know if a research topic I have come up with has already been researched on?
* Search exhaustively.
* Consult with others (preferably experts) in the area.

2. Why do I need to read a lot of papers in the same domain?
* To understand how different elements are emphasized for specific causes
* To understand how to write a paper in a way that it effectively differentiates from other papers of the same domain
  * Our draft should've focused on how simple our network is, and how simple our technique is, but still it yields great results.

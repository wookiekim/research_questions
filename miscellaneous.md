# Miscellaneous questions

1. How do I know if a research topic I have come up with has already been researched on?
* Search exhaustively.
* Consult with others (preferably experts) in the area.

2. Why do I need to read a lot of papers in the same domain?
* To understand how different elements are emphasized for specific causes
* To understand how to write a paper in a way that it effectively differentiates from other papers of the same domain
  * Our draft should've focused on how simple our network is, and how simple our technique is, but still it yields great results. 

3. How to improve on mathematical foundation?
* Make time to study Calculus, Probability Theory, Discrete Mathematics, Linear Algebra (Prof. Suha)
* Think a lot more about the equations in papers
  * What do they do, what meaning do they have

4. It's always important to "FULLY SCRUTINIZE" why such results were obtained
* Nontheless whether the results were good or bad
* Start with simple data
* **Visualize** along parts of the neural network (or any model in use)

5. Get used to the metrics/approaches in a lot of papers
* Cross-domain knowledge WORKS
  * even in CVPR2020, something from NLP->Vision (Image GPT)

6. Prof.Minsu: When reading a paper and introducing/summarizing it, make sure to check who the authors are, and which group they are from.

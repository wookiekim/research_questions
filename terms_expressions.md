#Glossary of terms and expressions

1. Efficacy
* the ability to produce a desired or intended result.

2. Isotropic kernel (Convolutional?)
* Kernel which depends only on the distance of the kernel arguments
  * ex) Discretized Gaussian, Direc Delta

3. Spurious
* not being whwat is purports to be, false or fake
* Apprently but not actually valid
* illegitimate
  ex) "find reliable matches by suppressing spurious ones.."
  
4. Fortuitious (lottery hypothesis)
* Happened by accident/ luck
  * "..the importance of these **fortuitious** initializations"

5. commensurate
* corresponding to size or degree; in proportion
  * Salary will commensurate with experience
  
6. Conducive
* good for, helpful to
  * "new architectures and initialization schemes with the same properties that are conducive to learning"

7. Latent
* Existing but not yet developed or manifest; hidden or concealed

8. Proxy
* Figure that can be used to represent the value of something in a calculation
  * Proxy-anchor
  * We use the iteration at which the early-stopping criterion is met as a proxy for how quickly the network learns.
  
9. "performance immediately suffers"

10. "results are more pronounced"

11. prime (v)
* Prepare (something) ready for use or action
  * "It is possible that dropout-induced sparsity primes a network to be pruned"

12. evocative(a)
* bringing strong images, memories, or feelings to mind
  * "we study the hypothesis on networks evocative of the architectures and techniques used in practice"

13. "conjectured" (adv for conjecture)

* not being whwat is purports to be, false or fake
* Apprently but not actually valid
* illegitimate
  ex) "find reliable matches by suppressing spurious ones.."
  
4. Fortuitious (lottery hypothesis)
* Happened by accident/ luck
  * "..the importance of these **fortuitious** initializations"

5. commensurate
* corresponding to size or degree; in proportion
  * Salary will commensurate with experience
  
6. Conducive
* good for, helpful to
  * "new architectures and initialization schemes with the same properties that are conducive to learning"

7. Latent
* Existing but not yet developed or manifest; hidden or concealed

8. Proxy
* Figure that can be used to represent the value of something in a calculation
  * Proxy-anchor
  * We use the iteration at which the early-stopping criterion is met as a proxy for how quickly the network learns.

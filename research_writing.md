# Research Writing

1. In comparative experiments, do I have to re-run (or re-implement) other methods of the same domain, for a fair comparison?
* Other lab members were seen to do so
* No, can just be copied from their paper - friend of mine

2. Writing tips - 1
* Do not use the word "good"
  * Rather, go for "efficient", "effective", "light-weight", "memory-efficient"...
  * i.e. be more specific
* The word "same" is almost always used in the form "the same"
* Using symbols (ex hat, bar, tilde) should befit their needs (ex hat for prediction, bar for sample mean...)
  * Usage of symbols outside of these needs may be confusing
  * In an absolute need to use a symbol, go for prime (')
* Always start a new paragraph with the main topic of the paragraph (as in thesis)
* "As follows" or "In the following...". No in-between
* Refrain from using "Works"
  * as a noun: work is an uncountable noun
  * as a verb: "works well" is not a good expression
* Stick to conventions when writing variables, constants, functions....
  * Deeplearning book reference
  * ex) hyperparameter -> lowercase greek letter
  * ex2) input constant -> uppercase italic
